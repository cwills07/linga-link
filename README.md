# Summary of Research
We performed an extensive competitive analysis of the existing language learning market space:
- Analyzing key features and aspects of Duolingo, HelloTalk, Babbel, and Busuu
- Conducting usability testing of these existing apps to categorize challenges and benefits based on user needs

During this analysis, we identified a privacy and security gap that users experience when connecting with others online

We conducted surveys of target users regarding their language learning motivations, needs, purpose, and benefits/concerns of a peer-to-peer learning approach. We also conducted in-depth interviews about users' privacy and security concerns.

# Design and Testing Process
We created the user personas based off of our initial user research. 
We conducted usability testing on the mid-fidelity and high fidelity prototypes. 

From our preliminary user survey results, we found that that the primary reason why people stopped using language learning apps was due to a loss of interest and motivation (63.6%). Many participants reported a gap in how existing apps did not help them learn conversationally relevant skills.

Quotes:
"Apps haven't been very successful in simulating conversations. So it can be hard to practice actually talking and forming your own sentences in the apps"

"It felt like I was learning vocabulary that wouldn't be used conversationally and not applicable if I were to go to the country"

## SWOT Analysis of Duolingo and HelloTalk
Duolingo is one of the most popular and dominant language learning platforms that focuses on gamification as the primary learning modality. Whereas HelloTalk is a global language learning app that focuses on peer-to-peer connections through chat, voice call, and video call modalities. Duolingo's weaknesses included limited explanations of grammar and cultural concepts. HelloTalk's weaknesses included growing user concerns about privacy and security as more restrictions and authorizations are needed in the app. 

## User Validation of Key Concepts
As we conducted more user interviews and usability testing of existing apps, our users highlighted the importance of structured learning environments, valued community features that allow users to connect with native speakers, as well as consistency and motivation. However, our users did report privacy and security related concerns and hesitations with connecting with strangers online.
