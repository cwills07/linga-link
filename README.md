# Summary of Research:
We performed an extensive competitive analysis of the existing language learning market space:
- Analyzing key features and aspects of Duolingo, HelloTalk, Babbel, and Busuu
- Conducting usability testing of these existing apps to categorize challenges and benefits based on user needs

During this analysis, we identified a privacy and security gap that users experience when connecting with others online

We conducted surveys of target users regarding their language learning motivations, needs, purpose, and benefits/concerns of a peer-to-peer learning approach. We also conducted in-depth interviews about users' privacy and security concerns.

# Design and Testing Process:
We created the user personas based off of our initial user research. 
We conducted usability testing on the mid-fidelity and high fidelity prototypes. 

Our research and design process informed the prototyping of the following key features:
1. Secure Onboarding
   - User verification through 2FA
   - Customizable avatars for users
   - Community guidelines
     
2. Verified User Matching
   - Users must approve lingua-link matches
   - Only approved matches can engage in conversation/chatting with each other
   - AI content and chat moderation
   - Flagging and blocking users for inappropriate behaviors
     
3. Personalized Language Learning
   - Users can practice lessons together
   - Customizable games and interactive lessons
   - Interactive progress tracking
